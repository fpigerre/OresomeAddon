OresomeAddon
============

OresomeAddon is a Google Chrome extension that allows [OresomeCraft](http://oresomecraft.com) users to receive personalised alerts.
Alerts are pulled from the OresomeCraft website and displayed in a neat popup.
When a user receives an alert, the OresomeAddon will also play a sound corresponding to the 'experience orb' minecraft sound and display a notification on their desktop.

### Development Setup

This add-on can be loaded as an unpacked extension into Google Chrome for development.
It is recommended, however, that it be loaded as a packed extension when not being used for development.
More information regarding loading unpacked extensions can be found in the [Chrome Developer documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).
